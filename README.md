# Networked Software for Distributed Systems

## Project Overview

This project is part of the coursework for the "Networked Software for Distributed Systems" class at Politecnico di Milano, held by prof. Luca Mottola and prof. Alessandro Margara during the academic year 2023-2024. The project explores various middleware technologies and frameworks, designed for large-scale network applications and distributed systems.

The key technologies covered in this project include:

- **AKKA**: A toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications on the JVM.
- **KAFKA**: A distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events per day.
- **SPARK**: An open-source distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.
- **CONTIKI NG**: An open-source operating system for the Internet of Things, designed for low-power, low-memory devices.
- **NODE RED**: A flow-based development tool for visual programming, primarily used to connect hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways.
- **MPI**: The Message Passing Interface, a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to function on parallel computing architectures.
